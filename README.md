# ðŸ˜Ž Tahir - avoid haram images/video on the web

Tahir is a Browser Extension that protects your eyes by automatically blurring all images and videos rendered on any page. Currently Tahir is available in Chrome and Firefox. You can install the extension for your browser from the following URLs:

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tahir/ihmoammkfbdpokfiiifajdkfglmfejca)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tahir/)

Our code is open source and we'll happily accept contributions from the community for bug fixes! There are plans to add additional
features such as whitelisting pages.

For now, we aren't actively working on a version of this extension for browsers other than Chrome and Firefox. However, if you'd like to
port it to another browser, feel free to open a pull request here on GitHub so we can add your contributions!
